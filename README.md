# AdaLod
Project DHDK for the master's degree program Knowledge Organization and Cultural Heritage held by Professor Tomasi.
The project aims to create a workflow from actual data to the level of abstraction, from interpretation of observation to conceptualization of theory, and from data modeling to data representation.
